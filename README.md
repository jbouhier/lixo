# Vite React Create App

Modern React + TypeScript app setup 

## Why
The [official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) do not explain how to start a simple project. [Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) used to be the defacto choice to do that but it has fallen short of attention in the past few years. The JavaScript ecosystem has muched changed with, for instance the [emergence of Vite build tool](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/build-tools/), offering significant better performance over [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
