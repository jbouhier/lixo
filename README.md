# Vite React Create App ‚öõÔ∏è

Modern React + TypeScript app setup  
powered by `Vite` build tool and `Vitest` test framework

## Why
The [official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) do not explain how to start a simple project. [Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) used to be the de facto choice for that, but
hasn't been properly maintained for the past few years. Since then, the JavaScript ecosystem has changed with, for instance the [emergence of Vite build tool](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/build-tools/), offering significant better performance over [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). 

This goal of this project is to address this lack for a simple solution.
